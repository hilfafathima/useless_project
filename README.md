### Project Description
The website "PotterStuff" is fun and entretaining especially for harry potter fans.It has a sorting ceremony as in hogwarts where the user gets sorted into one of the houses in hogwarts based on their characteristic traits and also there is a chat system where you can chat with the harry potter character "fred weasly" who gives  you funny replies and its quiet stress relieving 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
This is an entretaining website but still it helps people to understand their personality traits. and chatting with fred is a typical stress relief

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
fun, engagement and timepass and a big consideration for harry potter fans too.
